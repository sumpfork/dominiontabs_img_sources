# Dominion Divider Images
Image sources for the code in https://github.com/sumpfork/dominiontabs. These are often large files, thus git lfs hosted on a private installation.

If you want to contribute just send me a link to the images and I'll add them as this repo requires git lfs authentication.

These are not needed to use the divider generator - it includes flattened versions of these.
